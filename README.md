# Deep Denoising Autoencoders as Priors for Disparity Maps

In this work the source code for the Bachelors project is included. It contains all code necessary to construct the models used and also some of the trained networks analysed in the documentation. 

The code for the general scheme by <cite>[Zach et al.][1]</cite> was translated to python from the code of <cite>[Sanchez et al.][2]</cite>. The code presented also contains the scripts used for the optimization of Disparity Maps for Inpainting, Deblurring and Super Resolution.
