(For tvl1_dae.py)
The following implementation by Sánchez et al. [1] of the Dual TVL1 Optical Flow algorithm presented by Zach et al. [2] was translated into python by Yannick Bosch (yannick.bosch@uni-konstanz.de) and replaces the solution to the Total Variation based denoising problem within the scheme presented in [2] with a Denoising Autoencoder.

(For tvl2_dae.py)
The following implementation by Sánchez et al. [1] of the Dual TVL1 Optical Flow algorithm presented by Zach et al. [2] was translated into python by Yannick Bosch (yannick.bosch@uni-konstanz.de) and replaces the solution to the Total Variation based denoising problem within the scheme presented in [2] with a Denoising Autoencoder. Further instead of using an L1 loss this version uses an L2 loss.

(For mv_tvl2.py)
The following implementation by Sánchez et al. [1] of the Dual TVL1 Optical Flow algorithm presented by Zach et al. [2] was translated into python by Yannick Bosch (yannick.bosch@uni-konstanz.de).The algorithm was modified to work with lightfields (thus using an L2 loss).
